- 👋 Hi, I’m @katharinehogan
- 👀 I’m interested in plant conservation, grassland, community, and restoration ecology, land management, reproducibility in science, databases and data management, collaborative and co-producing science, and becoming less terrible at coding
- 🌱 I'm the Director of Conservation at Lauritzen Gardens in Omaha, Nebraska, USA
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any of the topics above (and others!)
- 📫 How to reach me: ResearchGate, LinkedIn, @dr.prairylandslide on BlueSky but honestly I don't really use it much.
