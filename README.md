- 👋 Hi, I’m @katharinehogan
- 👀 I’m interested in prairie, grassland, community, and restoration ecology, land management and conservation, reproducibility in science, databases and data management, innovative education resources, collaborative and co-producing science, and becoming less terrible at coding
- 🌱 I'm a post-doc working on an NSF project on grassland community assembly and ecosystem functioning at Northern Illinois University
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any of the topics above (and others!)
- 📫 How to reach me: @prairylandslide on Twitter, Katharine Hogan on ResearchGate, LinkedIn. If art is also your thing, hit me up at @prairylandslideart on Instagram.
