- 👋 Hi, I’m @katharinehogan
- 👀 I’m interested in community ecology, restoration ecology, databases and data management, innovative education resources, prairies and grasslands, collaborative and community based science and adaptive management, and becoming less terrible at coding
- 🌱 I’m a PhD candidate in natural resources and applied ecology (prairie restoration) at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ways to make the interface of simultaneously learning coding and statistics easier. No brilliant ideas, but I'm always thinking 
- 📫 How to reach me: @prairylandslide on Twitter, Katharine Hogan on ResearchGate, LinkedIn. If art is also your thing, hit me up at @prairylandslideart on Instagram.
